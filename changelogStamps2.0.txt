Changelog Stamps 2.0

Merging Stamps v1.1 with Labelconnector v1.5

changes to Stamps itself:

- changed the text on anchors/stamps to html to be able to colorize parts differently
- added new callbacks to ensure hide/disable functionality pressing D on Anchors (and preserving it's state with saving/loading)
- disabled PostageStamps by default. Defaulting to NoOps now.
- added jumpORcolor(), showConnections(), jumpKeepingPreviousSelection(), change_color_on_anchors()
- removed the check for name duplicates when creating new anchors/stamps. Nuke can do it by default with the node.setName() super fast. This improves speed quite tremendously! Collisions are still nto a problem, the new Anchor name might be just one digit apart, but that is as "collision proof" as any other random name when copying to another script.
- made some changes so the "drag node with ctrl-shift onto another node to switch their places" works now with stamps as well, without loosing their proper connections
- added USE_LABELCONNECTOR_UI constant to stamps_config.py to be able to switch between the old and new UI
- added the functionality to also derive different default colors based on e.g. naming, category, ... similar to default tags
- disabled all processing in the DeepExpression nodes used as stamps/anchors
- changed "except" to "except Exception" to comply with these new Python 3 guidelines

new UI:

- implemented UI from LabelConnector
    - adjusted UI to fit Stamps with Categories derived from Tags and/or Backdrops
    - Top row will show all categories, Tags on the left, Backdrops on the right
    - remembers previously selected category

    - character based search (similar to Nuke Node Menu, e.g. "rc" can resolve "Roto Character")
    - search is case insensitive
    - tab or enter creates top result
    - it always searches amongst all anchors, not just the selected category

- implemented Color UI from LabelConnector
    - ctrl+STAMPS_SHORTCUT with one or multiple Anchors selected
    - quickly change color of selected anchor
    - color will be changed on all stamps accordingly
    - COLOR_LIST in labelConnectorForStamps.py can be adjusted to your liking

new shortcuts (to make these even more handy, we have stamps on "E" by default. We didn't change the default in this version though, it's F8)

    in the new UI:
    - right click: temporarily set viewer to that anchor (click again or closing UI reverts to previous state)
    - shift+click: select and create multiple
    - alt+click: open color quick menu to colorize anchor
    - ctrl+click: jumps to anchor or category (also works on top row of UI)
    - ctrl+alt+click: jump/cycle through stamps

    outside of the UI:
    - ctrl+STAMPS_SHORTCUT: with one or multiple Anchors selected, set a new color
    - ctrl+STAMPS_SHORTCUT: with Stamp selected, will jump to it's anchor
    - shift+STAMPS_SHORTCUT: with one or multiple anchors or stamps selected, will select all stamps of their/that anchor
    - D: disable (hide) anchors. They won't show up in the new UI. (e.g. you load a different shot as ref into your comp)
